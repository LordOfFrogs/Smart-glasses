This project includes code for the wired glove I made for my smart glasses. The glasses themselves used a Vufine+ Wearable Display hooked up to a Raspberry Pi 5.

# Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico (microcontroller to connect to RPi 5)
- Custom PCB to connect to hall effect sensors (I made this to make the mess of cables slightly better, and to split the power and ground between the sensors)
- Adafruit BNC055
- Hall effect sensors
- Pushbuttons
- Wago Lever Nuts
- Wires (dupont or soldered directly)
- 3D printed parts (PETG)
- Elastic bands sewed on
- Magnets to trigger hall effect sensors
# CAD
Parts were CADded in Fusion360, and then 3D printed out of PETG.
